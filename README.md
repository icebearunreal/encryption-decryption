# encryption-decryption
Uses a simple caesar shift cipher alorithm; one which occured to me in a vision, 4 years ago.


# Process:
I hope you are familiar with the standard QWERTY keyboard, because most of you use it anyways. 
How this works, is that you *shift* each key to the right, and *map* it that way. If a key *overflows*, i.e, it has *no more alphabetical letters to shift to*, the key will go back to the *first* letter in the line of the QWERTY keyboard.
## Some example mappings:
| Original   | Ciphered   |
|------------|------------|
|A|S|
|B |N |
|C|V|

# NOTE: ALGORITHM UPDATES PENDING!!
